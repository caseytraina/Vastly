    # This will keep a cache of the ranks results for 2hrs. This is in place
    # because the datasets refresh every hour, and so we want the viewed videos to
    # be ignored until we can refresh the datasets. The pagination store will mean
    # that subsequent requests to the rank API will get new data until the cache expires
